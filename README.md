# Documentation Files

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for a statistical analysis workbook project, presented as interactive HTML documents.

## Files Overview

### Architecture-WorkBook.html
An interactive architecture documentation page that provides a comprehensive overview of the JavaScript statistical analysis workbook structure using UML diagrams.

### complete-document-revised.html
A complete documentation file containing the revised version of the statistical analysis workbook (content not shown but referenced in project structure).

## Architecture-WorkBook.html

### Purpose
This document serves as a technical architecture guide for developers working on or maintaining the statistical analysis workbook. It visualizes the system's structure and component relationships using interactive diagrams.

### Key Features

#### Interactive UML Diagrams
- **Component Architecture Diagram**: Shows relationships between data structures, mathematical functions, and visualization components
- **Sequence Diagram**: Illustrates the Ridge Regression Analysis flow
- **State Diagram**: Documents the complete document lifecycle
- **Function Call Graph**: Maps the execution flow of key functions

#### Documented Components
1. **DataModule**: Manages raw data arrays and parameter extraction
2. **MatrixOperations**: Core mathematical operations using math.js
3. **StatisticalSolvers**: OLS and Ridge regression implementations
4. **PredictionEngine**: Model predictions and performance metrics
5. **BayesianAnalysis**: Gamma distribution and posterior calculations
6. **VisualizationModule**: Plotly.js-based chart generation
7. **DOMController**: HTML element manipulation and updates

#### Technical Dependencies
- **Mermaid.js**: For rendering UML diagrams
- **Plotly.js**: Interactive plotting (referenced)
- **Math.js**: Matrix operations (referenced)
- **MathJax**: LaTeX equation rendering (referenced)

### Usage

#### Viewing the Documentation
1. Open `Architecture-WorkBook.html` in a web browser
2. The page will automatically load and render all diagrams
3. Diagrams are interactive and can be zoomed/panned
4. All components are documented with descriptions and relationships

#### For Developers
- Use this document to understand the system architecture before making changes
